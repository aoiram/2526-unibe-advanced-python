    "A divisor of a number, is another number that divides the first number without reminder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: 4 is a divisor of 20. 1 and the number itself are always divisors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `find_divisors` that takes a number in input and returns *all* its divisors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "find_divisors(20)  # returns [1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20]\n",
    "find_divisors(7)  # returns [1, 7]\n",
    "```"
